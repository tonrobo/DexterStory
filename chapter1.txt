We found Dexter on the Seattle Animal Rescue site. 

They said is was a rat terrier but he was part Chihuahua and part Italian greyhound mix. 

The Animal Rescue said he was two years old, cute as a button, loved people, children and other dogs, but actually he was 7 years old, cute as a button, hated people, hated children and hated other dogs. 

Dexter was on-the-spectrum and had many bad experiences. He would never be a perfect dog, but we decided we'll take him just the way he was and love him unconditionally.
