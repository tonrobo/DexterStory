As Dexter grows older, he has become somewhat loving and even, at times, cuddly. He trusts a little more than he did on Day One. He recovers from traumatic vet visits more quickly every year. He knows when we're upset and does try to comfort us when he is aware that we need comforting. He is doing the best he can and so are we and we love him for trying.
